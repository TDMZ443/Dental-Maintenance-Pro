Spent time speaking with partner, delegating tasks, and discussing where we're at.

9/23/25 Refined database connection process, rewrote equipment getter/display page, organized project files.

9/23/25 (later) Added user registration capability. Additional project organization and refinement.

9/25/25 Begun careful consideration of database structure/engineering. Conducted some research about database engineering practice,
and SQL capability.

9/29/25 Added login functionality (still a lot to do here like hashing, hash checking, cookies etc). 
Worked with partner through some next.js intricacies, read more about databases

9/30/25 Redesigned about half of the database. Begun working on 
integrating the front end with these new database changes

10/01/25 Made changes in the login, registration, and equipment
display to match changes made to the database. I.e. finishing the 
task described above

10/02/25 Added hashing functionality and password checking to login/registration. Did more planning on building the second
half of the database.

10/07/25 Made (i think?) the rest of the database. At least a good baseline for it. Will look more later.

10/08/25 Begun reading a bit about implementing langchain ai agents in to Next.js

10/13/25 Did a lot more research on langchain agents in Next.js. Found some online resources with
prebuilt agents that I can maybe start with to implement my own. Also did some planning on my next steps
